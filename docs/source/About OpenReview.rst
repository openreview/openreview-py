=============================


OpenReview aims to promote openness in scientific communication, particularly the peer review process, by providing a flexible cloud-based web interface and underlying database API enabling the following:

Open Peer Review

We provide a configurable platform for peer review that generalizes over many subtle gradations of openness, allowing conference organizers, journals, and other "reviewing entities" to configure the specific policy of their choice. We intend to act as a testbed for different policies, to help scientific communities experiment with open scholarship while addressing legitimate concerns regarding confidentiality, attribution, and bias.

Open Publishing 

Track submissions, coordinate the efforts of editors, reviewers and authors, and hostâ€¦ Sharded and distributed for speed and reliability.

Open Access 

Free access to papers for all, free paper submissions. No fees.

Open Discussion 

Hosting of accepted papers, with their reviews, comments. Continued discussion forum associated with the paper post acceptance. Publication venue chairs/editors can control structure of review/comment forms, read/write access, and its timing.

Open Directory 

Collection of people, with conflict-of-interest information, including institutions and relations, such as co-authors, co-PIs, co-workers, advisors/advisees, and family connections.

Open Recommendations 

Models of scientific topics and expertise. Directory of people includes scientific expertise. Reviewer-paper matching for conferences with thousands of submissions, incorporating expertise, bidding, constraints, and reviewer balancing of various sorts. Paper recommendation to users.

Open API 

We provide a simple REST API for accessing and uploading records of people, their groupings, document content, invitations and reviewing assignments, conflict-of-interest designations, and reviewing workflow patterns. You can then write scripts , all with a clear, robust model of read/write permissions. Track submissions, monitor review process, send customized bulk email messages, automate workflow actions.

Open Source 


We are committed to open source. Look for our public repo on GitHub soon.
