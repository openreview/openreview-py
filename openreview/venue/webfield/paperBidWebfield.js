      instructions: `**Instructions:**

- Please indicate your **level of interest** in reviewing the submitted papers below, on a scale from "Very Low" interest to "Very High" interest.
- Please bid on as many papers as possible to ensure that your preferences are taken into account.
- Use the search field to filter papers by keyword or subject area.
- Ensure that you have at least **${entity.minReplies} bids**.

**A few tips:**

- Papers for which you have a conflict of interest are not shown.
- Positive bids ("High" and "Very High") will, in most cases, increase the likelihood that you will be assigned that paper.
- Negative bids ("Low" and "Very Low") will, in most cases, decrease the likelihood that you will be assigned that paper.
