  The options provided in the form describe the most common set of variables that are requested. \
  That being said, OpenReview is built for flexibility, and it may be possible for us to accommodate special requests. \

  {heading: 'The OpenReview Paper Matching System', body: '<p class="dark">\
  OpenReview offers automated paper-reviewer assignment optimization and conflict of interest detection, \
  as well as a web interface for browsing, viewing statistics, and modifying the resulting assignments. \
  The OpenReview Matching System supports multiple optimization objectives and arbitrary numerical inputs as features for the match. \
  If you would like to use the OpenReview Paper Matching System for your venue, please indicate which features you would like to use in the form below. \
  If you want to make manual assignments, you can indicate that by deselecting all the options for the field "Paper Matching" in the request form. \
  Our most commonly used features are described in the following list: \
  <ul>\
  <li><strong>Reviewer Bid Scores</strong>: Reviewers indicate their preference to review papers via bids, which are then converted to scores.</li>\
  <li><strong>Reviewer Recommendation Scores</strong>: Reviewers, Area Chairs, and/or Program Chairs recommend specific reviewers to review papers. These recommendations are then converted to scores according to your specifications.</li>\
  <li><strong>OpenReview Affinity</strong>: Our in-house paper-reviewer affinity model. </li>\
  </ul>\
  </p>'},
  {heading: 'Public vs. Private content', body: '<p class="dark">\
  In terms of the openness of submissions, reviews, and comments, OpenReview offers pre-configured settings \
  that describe our most commonly requested permissions. We refer to them below as "Public" and "Private." \
  <ul>\
  <li><strong>Public</strong> content is visible to anyone who visits OpenReview.</li> \
  <li><strong>Private</strong> content is visible only to applicable venue officials. For example, \
  Private Reviews and Comments are visible only to the Program Chairs, to the Reviewers (and Area Chairs if applicable) assigned to the reviewed paper, \
  and to the paper\'s authors. Private Submissions are visible only to the Program Chairs, all Reviewers, and all Area Chairs.</li>\
  </ul>\
  If you would like a different set of permissions, please describe the permissions in the text-area at the end of the form.\
