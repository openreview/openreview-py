Affinity scores and/or conflicts could not be computed for the users listed under 'Without Profile'. You will not be able to run the matcher until all {role_name} have profiles. You have two options:

1. You can ask these users to sign up in OpenReview and upload their papers. After all {role_name} have done this, you will need to rerun the paper matching setup to recompute conflicts and/or affinity scores for all users.
2. You can remove these users from the {role_name} group: https://openreview.net/group/edit?id={matching_group}. You can find all users without a profile by searching for the '@' character in the search box.
