        message=f'''Hi {{{{fullname}}}},

With this email, we request that you manage the review process for a new TMLR submission titled "{note.content['title']['value']}".

As a reminder, TMLR Action Editors (AEs) are **expected to accept all AE requests** to manage submissions that fall within your expertise and quota. Reasonable exceptions are 1) situations where exceptional personal circumstances (e.g. vacation, health problems) render you incapable of fully performing your AE duties or 2) you have a conflict of interest with one of the authors. If any such exception applies to you, contact us at tmlr@jmlr.org .

Your first task is to make sure the submitted preprint is appropriate for TMLR and respects our submission guidelines. Clear cases of desk rejection include submissions that are not anonymized, submissions that do not use the unmodified TMLR stylefile and submissions that clearly overlap with work already published in proceedings (or currently under review for publication). If you suspect but are unsure about whether a submission might need to be desk rejected for any other reasons (e.g. lack of fit with the scope of TMLR or lack of technical depth), please email us.

Please follow this link to perform this task: https://openreview.net/forum?id={note.id}

If you think the submission can continue through TMLRâ€™s review process, click the button "Under Review". Otherwise, click on "Desk Reject". Once the submission has been confirmed, then the review process will begin immediately, and your next step will be to assign 3 reviewers to the paper.

We thank you for your essential contribution to TMLR!

The TMLR Editors-in-Chief
