We are sorry to inform you that, after consideration by the assigned Action Editor, your {journal.short_name} submission titled "{submission.content['title']['value']}" has been rejected without further review.

Cases of desk rejection include submissions that are not anonymized, submissions that do not use the unmodified {journal.short_name} stylefile and submissions that clearly overlap with work already published in proceedings (or currently under review for publication).

To know more about the decision, please follow this link: https://openreview.net/forum?id={submission.forum}
